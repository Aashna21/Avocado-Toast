1.) Put your top and bottom slices of Ciabatta bread in the toaster on whichever setting you prefer your bread to be toasted at.
2.) While your breads are toasting, take your medium sized knife and slice your fresh avocado in half on your cutting board. 
3.) Once you have cut your avocado into two halves, use your butter knife to scoop one of the halves of avocado into your first bowl. 
4.) Once half of an avocado is in your first bowl, add however much grinded salt and pepper you want. 
5.) After adding your desired quantities of grinded salt and pepper, use your butter knife and mash up the avocado; mix it with the grinded salt and pepper. 
6.) By now, the Ciabatta bread will have popped out of the toaster, and if they have not yet come out, wait until they do. 
7.) When your breads are out of the toaster, put them on a plate, and equally spread your guacomole on them. 
8.) After spreading guacomole on the two breads, fill your second bowl with a little bit of olive oil. 
9.) Then, use your teaspoon to spread a little bit of olive oil over the two breads. 
10.) Finally, add however much paprika you want on top of your breads. That's all, enjoy!
